INTRODUCTION
Many studies have reported a negative correlation between aging and working memory (Klencklen, and al. 2017). The working memory, firstly introduced by Baddeley in 1974, is a cognitive process that enables to keep in memory a certain amount of information during a short period. This type of memory can be perfectly illustrated in a spatial working memory task (Song, and al., 2013). 
Therefore, this project aims to show a decline of the working memory with aging, by programming a spatial working memory task performed by individuals from two types of individuals: young adults (from 18 to 30 years) and adults (over 30 years). This aged delimitation has been done seconding the presumably apogee of the working memory at the end of the teenagehood (25-30 years), preceding the decline of this type of memory (Klingberg, 2007).
