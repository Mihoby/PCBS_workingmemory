## INTRODUCTION

Many studies have reported a negative correlation between aging and working memory (Klencklen, and al. 2017). The working memory, firstly introduced by Baddeley in 1974, is a cognitive process that enables to keep in memory a certain amount of information during a short period. This type of memory can be perfectly illustrated in a spatial working memory task (Song, and al., 2013). 
Therefore, this project aims to show a decline of the working memory with aging, by programming a spatial working memory task performed by individuals from two types of individuals: young adults (from 18 to 30 years) and adults (over 30 years). This aged delimitation has been done seconding the presumably apogee of the working memory at the end of the teenagehood (25-30 years), preceding the decline of this type of memory (Klingberg, 2007). 

Before the experiment, the age of the participant will be collected, such as creating a cumulative plot with 2 independent variables (2 age categories) of all the participants for the experimenter at the end of the passations. 
The task will consist of 3 blocks of 4 trials. In each trial, a virgin matrix of 3x3 will be presented, and the block will begin 2 seconds after the participant pressed the space bar. Colors corresponding to a specific localisation on the matrix will successively and randomly pop up such as creating a sequence of 5, 7, and 9 colors corresponding to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd block. This way, the difficulty of the task increases. 
The colors appear successively at a speed 1/500 ms. 
At the end of each trial, the participant will have to reproduce the sequence: either by clicking on the cell of the matrix or by assimilating the digit pad to the matric cells.

Once the participant did the 5, 7 or 9 manipulations seconding the block, the subject is not informed of the success of the task and the following trial begins after a 2 seconds black screen.
Each block is separated by a black screen, and starts when the participant press the spacebar. 
 At the end of all the blocks, the participant will be informed by a plot of his/her successness by blocks. There will be an average of the trials per block for his/her participation.
 
  The experiment collects the data of each participant and all the data will be little by little added to an overall plot, distinguishing the 2 categories of participants, only for the purpose of the experimenters.
